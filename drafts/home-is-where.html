<p>I recently visited my parents as a quick trip to see just them. They still live in my home city, though a distance from where I grew up. It was a little emotional as I opened up about some feelings with them, past, trauma I've begun to heal from -- some inadvertently caused by them.</p>
<p>Both were incredibly apologetic, and loving, and I reassured them it was okay -- they didn't really know what we know now about ADHD, or doctors didn't know very much at the pediatrician level at least. Every time I was acting out and asked "have you taken your medicine?" it stung, but I didn't have words to articulate why when I was so young. It felt...controlling. It felt manipulative.</p>
<p>But that was never the intent. To their perception, I was being uncharacteristically loud and obnoxious. They were asking somewhat genuinely, even if heatedly in frustration. But there was one thing in common with every one of those times:</p>
<p>We were somewhere noisy with a lot of stimulation.</p>
<p>Overstimulation wasn't well-understood as a difficulty for folks with ADHD at the time, that the focus could get tugged like sparks rapidly firing over each input, rapidly causing burnout and turmoil. As a kid, that expressed in me being more rambunctious, but to me I wasn't being any different. That's what was so hard to understand for both of us at the time -- I couldn't communicate the differences in how my mind was working well enough for them to recognize, and they weren't equipped with the right knowledge. The understanding alone is ammends for me now, and I'm grateful that my parents have been happy to learn more about me, from me. To accept and care.</p>
<p>But that's not really what prompted this post.</p>
<h3 id="where-is-home">Where is home?</h3>
<p>Today I heard a Noah Kahan song I'd not heard yet: "<a href="https://youtu.be/O53pjBjmojQ">The View Between Villages</a>". As I listened, I had to rewind to listen again. Something was sticking out hard to me, and I had to listen more closely to see why.</p>
<p>To preface, every time I visit my parents, it feels like there's a gentle slope everywhere leading me back to their house, and then from there to where I live down here in Alabama. But that slope gets much steeper, becoming nearly a cliff, the closer I get to places steeped in memories for me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Passed Alger Brook Road, I'm over the bridge</p>
<p>A minute from home, but I feel so far from it</p>
<p>The death of my dog, the stretch of my skin</p>
<p>It's all washing over me, I'm angry again</p>
<p>The things that I lost here, the people I knew</p>
<p>They got me surrounded for a mile or two</p>
<p>The car's in reverse, I'm gripping the wheel</p>
<p>I'm back between villages and everything's still.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This alone just... gripped hard, putting words to a feeling I'd felt first... Shoot, 12? 14? years ago. I was visiting my parents for the first time since they'd left the home I grew up in, and it'd been over a year since that move. I was riding in the car with my mom driving, and because we were in the neighborhood, she offered to show me our old home. I accepted.</p>
<p>As we got closer, I was gripping the seat arm rest and door grip more tightly, but I didn't know why. There was a nameless anxiety building in me, quiet, smoldering. And when we got to the street, I felt pushed back, and finally saw the house.</p>
<p>It was changed. It looked familiar, and yet so distant. The robin's egg blue it used to be painted in was gone, the roof was no longer red -- replaced with a black one. The brick walls of the front garden courtyard were gone, much less the old wrought iron gates my mom had used broken coat hangers to attach to the old hinges the rotten wooden doors used to be attached to. Nowhere for hanging the wreaths we used to hang in the winter. The flower beds I and my mom and sister tended gone. The spot where my dad would burn sticks in the fall in a burn barrel was broken away, no longer even a parking spot.</p>
<p>The maple tree my sister planted when she was still a small child was gone.</p>
<p>I didn't look to see if the one I'd planted in the back yard when I was that age was still there.</p>
<p>(Sorry if it got heavy or weird there. That was just... a lot to write, a lot of memories surfacing.)</p>
<p>For the first time, the weight of where I was in life sank in. I didn't have anywhere to call home. My parent's new house didn't feel like home, it didn't feel like...them. It felt weirdly like my grandparent's house on my mom's side.</p>
<p>And where I lived down here was just...temporarily home. Somewhere I was staying. I didn't have home.</p>
<p>Memories of my sister and I checking our heights as we grew marked on a door frame, a frame that no longer showed them, hadn't for a while. I'd watched it get painted over. Memories of my losing my own dog there, and the pain of that loss right after my grandfather.</p>
<p>Memories of raking leaves in the back yard, filling up bags that were attached together to look like a spider to put in the front yard when Halloween came. Of jumping in leaf piles. Of climbing the tree in the front yard, both the huge oak and then the pine tree. Of growing tomatoes out on the old roof and the smell of the hot tar in the summer mixed with the smell of hot tomato vines.</p>
<p>I felt surrounded by somewhere that was simultaneously familiar and far away. I wanted to be out of there. I didn't process it as emotionally at the time, I just felt...bad. I told my mom I didn't want to be there anymore, and I think she could see it on me before I even said. We turned around and went back to their house, but it was just a place to stay. After the visit I went back to my apartment, but it was somewhere I lived.</p>
<p>For a long time I lived in one apartment that'd kind of become home. It had to. I think I hadn't had the growth I needed to find myself though. And until then I couldn't really find whatever 'home' was.</p>
<p>Once I moved into my duplex unit at the end of 2019 I started to feel like I was making a home. It was sparse, but it was cozy, and it made me feel welcome. I had somewhere to go. When I moved into my triplex unit, I quickly was able to feel like it was home, especially as I started filling it out. It felt comfy. But so did somewhere else.</p>
<p>Wherever my walf lived. Maybe that's part of why my unit feels like home, it's where he lived for a while before I moved in. But his place also kind of has that same feel, I don't feel funneled to my place, it feels like they're just...connected.</p>
<p>And listening to the song, thinking about all this feeling I had of how the sense of somewhere welcoming had gone had me wondering.</p>
<p>Maybe 'home' for some is not so much a location, but a state of being. It's the combination of your own sense of self, well-being, and maybe the people you're with.</p>
<p>Anyway. This was just a long ramble about thoughts of the past this song welled up, and thinking about that weird displaced feeling even when nothing's preventing me from being there, or from having a proper place to go and rest. I'm a dork and songs make me emotional sometimes.</p>
<p>May not even publish this.</p></span>
