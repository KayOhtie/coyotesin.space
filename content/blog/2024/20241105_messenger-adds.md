Fore-warning, I basically completely disregard fanfare and repeatedly mention the concept of someone, anyone, getting off, because I wish they'd be honest they want that.

-----

Look, I literally do not care if:

- you thought my sona or characters were horny
- you got off to porn art of me
- you got off to completely non-sexual art of me
- you want to RP with me

Just fuckin say so. I'd rather candidness than dodgy weird bullshit about "I just want to be friends" ok but why me? If you supposedly found me in a discord server we mysteriously shared JUST before I looked at the add request the second it appeared, why me out of anyone else? Or what was the server about? "Fursona" or "furry" is a fucking dodgy answer because I'm in no such generic furry servers, they're all either for a friend, a community, or a kink. Be specific.

"I think you are this way because of all the scammers" well yeah but also I'm fucking tired of carrying conversations and whatnot. They sound like that one ambassador in that TNG episode who kept telling Picard she'd jump til she morphed back into the ambassador when he called the bluff, a broken record.

Just....grrrrr.

Hell this even goes for non scammers. I'd really prefer people be forthright with me on why they added me. I'm direct when I message people cause I know how irritating "hi" out of the blue is from someone you don't even know.

- "Hey, I love the commissions you get and I'd love to talk about blimpy things".
- "Hey, you're a sexy balloon and I wanted to tell you that and also see if you have more"
- "Hey, you're a cute balloon and I know this is awkward but I got off to you being inflated, 
- "Hey, I wanna inflate you/you inflate me in RP, because I like your character"

Just be honest and direct. And if you really, *really* don't know why you added me other than "to be friends" -- I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you other than I do not have the brain space to forge a friendship out of trying to find something in common for you. You came to me, you need to bring something to the table here, that's only fair to me.

I know this is venty and stupid but I'm just stunned with how this has happened several times and I never can tell which is a scammer who's claiming they're not early on so they can ask me to test their game in a week or what. Argh.
